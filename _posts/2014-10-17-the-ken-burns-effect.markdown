		<p class="intro">In a weird cafe somewhere in Amsterdam, the Ken Burns Effect play their first concert. A guy with a guitar plays before them, and an old slightly drunk french lady dances to their songs that go just above the allowed decibel level.</p>

		<p class="quote">The Bourgeoisie have saved you,<br>
		they'll tell you what to do.</p>
		<p class="quote">They are the answer,<br>
		are the questions,<br>
		know everything.</p>
		<p class="source">&dash; from the song “Eddie Vedder”.</p>

		<p>So are the words written and performed by the self described ‘Indie Rock’ band, led by electric guitar playing Jacob Kollar. Michael Collette plays drums and Samuel Markusse plays the base.</p>

		<p>Both Michael and Jacob are a part of YWAM Amsterdam. When I ask Jacob why they play Indie Rock, he starts to laugh and says: It’s all I can play. That’s about as deep as it gets.</p>

		<p>The song Eddie Vedder is about how people in modern society don’t think about anything anymore. You do what you’re told, and it’s directed by the majority. It’s a stab at people thinking they know everything, Jacob explains.</p>

		<p>The second verse is about people going organic because it makes yourself feel better. I’m never going out to make a statement, that’s a byproduct. I write about stuff that more or less pisses me off. Jacob calls the songs a select set of “ramblings of his thoughts.”</p>

		<p class="quote">“It’s the shallowness of peoples desire to make themselves better that irritates me”</p>

		<p class="quote">“We forgot a bunch of stuff we shouldn’t have forgotten”</p>

		<h3>How long have you been playing music?</h3>
		I started to learn popular music on guitar when i was 12. I taught myself to play “under the bridge” by Red Hot Chili Peppers and “Nothing Else Matters” (Metallica). i tried to start a band in highschool but I wasn’t really around the right type of guys. 

		Jacob:
		Who: An Australian, a student in the field of communications. Studied at Griffiths University in Queensland, Australia.

		<p>Living and working in Amsterdam.</p>
		<p>Interested in how we engage youth and future generations and answering the question, “how do you to talk to other people when there are so many other things talking to them.”</p>

		<p>The vision of the group is to play throughout the Netherlands and for Jacob personally, to build relationships with all those who hear the music.</p>

		<p>According to Jacob the vision for the band did not just emerge recently, it has been a long time in the making. “I came here [to Amsterdam] to work, to get out and reach and influence,” Jacob said.  “Originally I’d been playing with Samuel and another guy… and we just played for a long time.” Over the past three years, both Samuel and Jacob began to play more and more together.  Their music began to evolve to fit the tastes of what both Samuel and Jacob enjoyed the most as their styles began to mesh.</p>

		<p class="quote">“Over that time we had always wanted a band to play together,”</p>

		<p>The answer came in the form of Michael Collette. It took him a bit of convincing, but now, as a unit, they’ve finished their first round of recordings.</p>

		<p>He probably sells himself short with that description.  There is no doubt listening to the songs they are designed to be witty and meaningful insights into relationships, the world and the culture moving around us.</p>

		<p>One song that we dig into is “Eddie Vedder”.</p>

		<p>Jacob calls it a, “stab at a world that thinks we know an answer to everything.”</p>

		<p class="quote">We are, we are, extraordinary<br>
		We hold the secret answers of everything to know</p>
		<p class="source">-Eddie Vedder.</p>

		<p>The lyrics are a punch at a world that too easily sells our vanities as our ticket to self-success.</p>

		<p>“It’s about the way people are always looking to see about the concern everyone has for themselves and how awesome we think we are,” why does this bother you?</p>

		<p>It’s a theme that is not isolated to Eddie Vedder, in the song Hot Stuff we once again see a stinging critique of society to view relationships as commodities instead of something more genuine,</p>

		<p class="quote">I'm the stuff, hot stuff,<br>and I'm not talking with you,<br>unless you give me something,<br>I can use.</p>

		<h3>The Future</h3>

		<p>Jacob and the group are thankful that YWAM Amsterdam has become a centre for innovation with their music and creativity, and are now looking beyond.</p>

		<p>For Jacob, he wants to break out of what he calls the “Christian circuit,” and have a broader influence with their music.</p>

		<p>With Michael joining the band, the vision has grown.  They have just finished their first round of recordings and are looking to play throughout the Netherlands and from there, Belgium and Germany and whatever else there is in store for them.</p>

		<p>It’s clear listening to Jacob that the band is there to be creative and to make the world a little more beautiful.</p>
